# jvdenn.github.io

This is the repo for my webpage, by typing [https://jvdenn.github.io/](https://jvdenn.github.io/) into the address bar, my webpage will appear.

Using Jekyll:

For this website I used Jekyll, which lets me save time by saving layouts to use on other pages in the site. It also helps populate fields instead of manual typing such as filling out the page title or url or content.
